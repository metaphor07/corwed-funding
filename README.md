# Decentralized corwed-funding
>PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is "DECENTRALIZED CROWED FUNDING APPLICATION", In this application:-
1. User can create any campaign
2. User can donate any on-going campaign
3. The raised amount will directly send to the owner of the campaign no third party involvement.

In this application no third-party involvement, so the 100% raised amount is delevired to the owner of the campaign.
Because of that no scam or fraud is happen with the funds donated by the user.

You can read the smart contract as well which is available in the web3 folder and you can see the test of the smart contract in the same folder
To connect the smart contract with the client side, we are basically used web3.js and to run the application properly we have to metamask in your chrome.
